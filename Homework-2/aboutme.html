    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    <h2>Basic information</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Patrick I am a 35 year old programming student hoping to expand
      my knowledge of coding and programming as well as my bank account. I
      currently live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota with one of my best friends
      Ben, who is also taking this class with us. A class taught by my other
      best friend Dustin! I've lived here the majority of my life but also in a
      few other places.
    </p>
    <ul>
      Such as:
      <li>Texas</li>
      <li>Nebraska</li>
      <li>Minnesota</li>
      <li>Ohio</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Not so basic information</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently single and without children. My mother and step father are
      both around and in my life. I have one older brother who is fairly
      accentric (not in a good way). And no pets. <br /><em
        >Although if I had any cats they would all be better than Dustin's. And
        I'm sorry to say it, dude, but let's be honest.. it's a fact. If I
        raised cats they'd be little gods and goddesses. Don't argue with
        me.</em
      ><br />
      I've done little schooling passed High School and currently work in the
      kitchen of the best grocery chain I've ever shopped at, Hy-Vee. But, I
      have worked at many other jobs.

    <h2>I've got no idea what I'm doing with my life</h2>
    <p>
      I'm old and single working <em>another</em> dead-end job with a string of
      nothing to show for it. But that's why we're here, isn't it? I'm lucky to
      have such amazing friends in my life, even if there's only a couple of
      them. I'm gonna make the best of this.
    </p>
    <h2>La langue française</h2>
