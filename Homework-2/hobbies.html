      If you haven't noticed by this point, I may be worried about you. One of
      my favorite amusements in life is to make the mundane more joyous. I don't
      always do a spectacular job, but I do put my all into it. I believe life
      will always be more worth living if we all find ways to smile and laugh
      more.

    <h2>Visual Entertainment</h2>

      I've spent copious amounts of time indulging in the joy of Film,
      Television, and Anime. I enjoy exploring new ones and revisiting old ones.
      It has proven, throughout the years, to be fun alone or with friends.

    <h3>Here are a few I love</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>There's Something About Mary</dt>
      <dd>
        A romantic comedy with a wonderful premise, fantastic comedic bits, and
        great chemistry between the main characters.
      </dd>
      <dt>Chuck</dt>
      <dd>
        A hilarious yet cheesey spy show that also has some amazing chemistry
        between it's entire main cast.
      </dd>
      <dt>One Piece</dt>
      <dd>
        Currently my favorite anime with an amazing ensemble of main characters,
        gut busting comedy, and some of the most extensive and incredible world
        building I've seen to date.

    <h2>Games Games Games</h2>
    <p>
      I am probably not what you would consider a typical gamer these days.. No
      Fortnite, No Call of Duty, No Rocket League. And no willingness to play
      any of those games. In fact it can be pretty rare that I play most video
      games.. I tend to dabble in a few.. but it's mostly been some card games,
      board games, tabletop role playing games, and a couple MMO's.
