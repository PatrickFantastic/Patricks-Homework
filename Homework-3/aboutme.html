      <h1>About Myself</h1>
      <h2>Basic information</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        My name is Patrick I am a 35 year old programming student hoping to
        expand my knowledge of coding and programming as well as my bank
        account. I currently live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota with one of my
        best friends Ben, who is also taking this class with us. A class taught
        by my other best friend Dustin! I've lived here the majority of my life
        but also in a few other places.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-container">
        Such as:
        <li class="list">Texas</li>
        <li class="list">Nebraska</li>
        <li class="list">Minnesota</li>
        <li class="list">Ohio</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Not so basic information</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am currently single and without children. My mother and step father
        are both around and in my life. I have one older brother who is fairly
        accentric (not in a good way). And no pets. <br /><em
          >Although if I had any cats they would all be better than Dustin's.
          And I'm sorry to say it, dude, but let's be honest.. it's a fact. If I
          raised cats they'd be little gods and goddesses. Don't argue with
          me.</em
        ><br />
        I've done little schooling passed High School and currently work in the
        kitchen of the best grocery chain I've ever shopped at, Hy-Vee. But, I
        have worked at many other jobs.

      <h2>I've got no idea what I'm doing with my life</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I'm old and single working <em>another</em> dead-end job with a string
        of nothing to show for it. But that's why we're here, isn't it? I'm
        lucky to have such amazing friends in my life, even if there's only a
        couple of them. I'm gonna make the best of this.
