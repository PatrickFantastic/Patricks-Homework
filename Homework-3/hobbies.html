        If you haven't noticed by this point, I may be worried about you. One of
        my favorite amusements in life is to make the mundane more joyous. I
        don't always do a spectacular job, but I do put my all into it. I
        believe life will always be more worth living if we all find ways to
        smile and laugh more.

        I've spent copious amounts of time indulging in the joy of Film,
        Television, and Anime. I enjoy exploring new ones and revisiting old
        ones. It has proven, throughout the years, to be fun alone or with
        friends.

      <h3>Here are a few I love with brief descriptions.</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>There's Something About Mary</dt>
        <dd>
          A romantic comedy with a wonderful premise, fantastic comedic bits,
          and great chemistry between the main characters.
        </dd>
        <dt>Chuck</dt>
        <dd>
          A hilarious yet cheesey spy show that also has some amazing chemistry
          between it's entire main cast.
        </dd>
        <dt>One Piece</dt>
        <dd>
          Currently my favorite anime with an amazing ensemble of main
          characters, gut busting comedy, and some of the most extensive and
          incredible world building I've seen to date.

      <h2>Games Games Games</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am probably not what you would consider a typical gamer these days..
        No Fortnite, No Call of Duty, No Rocket League. And no willingness to
        play any of those games. In fact it can be pretty rare that I play most
        video games.. I tend to dabble in a few.. but it's mostly been some card
        games, board games, tabletop role playing games, and a couple MMO's.
